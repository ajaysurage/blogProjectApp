But they always tell you something—especially when you can compare them across the years, to see how an author’s self-presentation has evolved over time.\n\nThis is all to say that I have recently spent some time digging up the early author photos of a handful of famous writers, and comparing them to their current (or recent) author photos. Not just snapshots, mind—but the actual publicity photographs used on their books, or in some cases, their websites. For true “then and now” action, I’ve limited the scope to living authors, so with that in mind, feel free to add on to the list below.",

        "description": "One of my favorite things about skulking around old bookstores is the possibility of chancing upon a first edition of a beloved author’s early work and looking at it in its original context—not repackaged nor redesigned, not yet Made into a Major Motion Picture, and still boasting the kind of blurbs you get before you’re a literary superstar (honest, I mean, or as honest as blurbs get). Plus, there’s often the original author photo, which might be years or decades old. That’s always the most fun.\n\nWe grow to recognize authors so well by their author photos (particularly now that those photos may also be attached to their tweets and other electronic traces).
